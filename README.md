This project contains 3 E2E tests for Betty Blocks assigment

I used Cypress QA tool for testing which made it easy to create tests and perform them


For run E2E tests:

1. Clone repository
2. Run  `npm install`
3. For run tests use command `npx cypress run -b chrome`

 This will allow run all tests in headless mode (without running visual browser)
